This project is a WIFI reputation tracking system.
The system is a server that manages the devices connected to the wifi network.

I used spring- boot (an open source Java-based framework) to create a rest API based server.
The project should be imported as Maven project and run as a Java application (i used eclipse to develop and run the app).

All requests should follow the contract:
	---------------------------- 
	a.	Wifi Network
		{
			"id" : "123456",
			"auth": <can be either 'wpa' or 'public'>,
			"avg_throughput": <a float of average bandwidth in mbit/sec >
			"devices":[{"id":"a1b2"},{"id":"c3d4"}]
		}

	b.	API  
		i. fetch network by id 
		Request: 
		GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/my-service/api/network?id=123456
	
		Response: 
		JSON of wifi network

		ii. connect device to network (if no such network exists, create new one)
		Request: 
		PUT http://127.0.0.1:8080/my-service/api/network/connect
		{
			"device_id": "a1b2",
			"network_id": "123456",
			"auth" : "wpa"
		}

		iii. report network throughput
		Request: 
		POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/my-service/api/network/report
		{
			"device_id": "a1b2",
			"network_id": "123456",
			"throughput" : 500
		}
		Response: 
		ok/error

To create Http requests I used postman tool.
